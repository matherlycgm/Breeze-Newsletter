            <p>Taylor Swift’s 10th studio album, “Midnights,” was released Oct. 21, and it’s already breaking well-deserved Spotify records and continuing to demonstrate the artist’s musical genius. </p>

            <p>Considering Swift left fans speechless when her last two albums, “folklore” and “evermore,” both dropped in 2020, it was a complete surprise — to me at least — when Blondie announced another album, especially after hearing its inspiration stems from what keeps her up late at night.</p>

            <p>While I was ecstatic Swift decided to add to her already astounding discography, I was completely clueless when it came to any expectations about the sound this album would have. After all, Swift has become known for being able to master any kind of genre there is.</p>

            <p>I was excited to see whether Swift was going to bring us back to her roots with a country sound, or if she’d continue with the stripped-back storytelling of “evermore” and “folklore,” or if she was going to reinstate her edgy “Reputation” era.</p>

            <p>After going in completely blind, I was extremely pleased with the poppy, drum-heavy, techy sound Swift brought with “Midnights.” This album stands out compared to all her previous ones because of the ultra-produced quality it seems to carry.</p>

            <p>JMU and Old Dominion (ODU) Athletics announced The TowneBank Royal Rivalry Challenge on Wednesday, according to a press release. The challenge is an effort to formalize both schools’ decades-long rivalry. </p>

            <p>“The chance to have a strong in-state rival again is one of the best things about joining the Sun Belt Conference,” ODU athletic director Wood Selig said in the press release. “Now that we will play every year, we rekindle a spirited sports rivalry that brings together students and alumni from across the Commonwealth.” </p>

            <p>The rivalry is a point system for all athletics programs, where each school earns a point for every head-to-head matchup their teams win throughout the regular season and postseason, or for finishing better in a mutual conference championship event where head-to-head matchups don’t occur. Half points are rewarded in the event of a tie or draw. </p>

            <p>Not all universities are equal. </p>

            <p>Schools focus their resources in different areas and programs, and universities also receive various amounts in government funding and in endowments. The discrepancy in the amount of funding a university receives from external sources can often reflect the quality of the education a student can expect to receive there. These factors contribute to how prospective students and employers perceive the prestige of a university. </p>

            <p>Prestigious schools, especially those that constitute the Ivy League, a collection of schools concentrated in the northeast U.S. and founded in 1954 — including Harvard, Princeton, Yale and others — provide unique access to highly credentialed faculty and desirable research opportunities. However, their perceived prestige inflates their value. These perceptions have negatively affected the American higher education system in a way that removes opportunities from those who can’t afford the high price tags that come with prestige, ultimately perpetuating income inequality and feeding elitism.  </p>
